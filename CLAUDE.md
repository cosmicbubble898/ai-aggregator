# AI Aggregator — Claude Code guide

**Current phase:** Foundation pre-flight clean. Ready for gh auth login and first commit.

## Context imports

@AGENTS.md
@docs/project-brief.md
@docs/architecture.md
@docs/prd/phase-1.md

## Session continuity

Every session ends by updating `docs/session-log/SESSION-<date>.md`. Every session starts by reading the most recent session log + this file. The repo is the source of truth — no context should live only in a session.

### Session start protocol

Paste this at the start of every new session:

> Read CLAUDE.md, then read the most recent file in docs/session-log/. Confirm you understand: (a) the project's current phase, (b) what the last session accomplished, (c) what's next. Then ask me what we're working on today before doing anything else.

## Specialist subagents (optional delegation)

This project defines specialist subagents in `.claude/agents/`. They are **available helpers, not a mandate** — delegate to one when it genuinely helps (parallel work, isolated review, focused expertise); the main session may also do the work directly when staying in one context is better.

- **code-reviewer** (read-only) — invoke proactively after writing/modifying code and **before any commit**.
- **docs-reviewer** (read-only) — reviews documentation & learning content for accuracy + beginner clarity. **Run it before committing or pushing any learning content** (`docs/learn/**`, README, `ONBOARDING.md`) — a wrong lesson mis-teaches, so the bar is higher than for code.
- **backend-agent** — server-side: API routes, server actions, Auth.js, Drizzle/Neon, R2, env & integrations.
- **frontend-agent** — client UI: components, pages/layouts, state, forms, CSS, accessibility.
- **devops-agent** — deploy config, CI/CD, env/secrets, platform setup (Vercel/Neon/R2).

Routing is soft-enforced only (a prompt contract, not a hard boundary), so there is no rigid "never execute directly" rule for now — revisit if the codebase grows. When delegating to multiple agents, prefer running non-overlapping ones in parallel.

**Session-end:** Before ending any session, Claude Code must offer to update the session log (`docs/session-log/SESSION-<date>.md`).
